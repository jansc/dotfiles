##################################################

[general]

# This variable specifies which accounts are defined.  Separate them
# with commas.  Account names should be alphanumeric only.
# You will need to specify one section per account below.  You may
# not use "general" for an account name.

accounts = Fastmail

# You can specify one or more user interface modules for OfflineIMAP
# to use.  OfflineIMAP will try the first in the list, and if it
# fails, the second, and so forth.
#
# The pre-defined options are:
# Blinkenlights -- A fancy (terminal) interface
# TTYUI         -- a text-based (terminal) interface
# Basic         -- Noninteractive interface suitable for cron'ing
# Quiet         -- Noninteractive interface, generates no output
#                  except for errors.
# MachineUI     -- Interactive interface suitable for machine
#                  parsing.
#
# You can override this with a command-line option -u.

ui = quiet

# If you try to synchronize messages to a folder which the IMAP server
# considers read-only, OfflineIMAP will generate a warning.  If you want
# to suppress these warnings, set ignore-readonly to yes.  Read-only
# IMAP folders allow reading but not modification, so if you try to
# change messages in the local copy of such a folder, the IMAP server
# will prevent OfflineIMAP from propagating those changes to the IMAP
# server.  Note that ignore-readonly is unrelated to the "readonly"
# setting which prevents a repository from being modified at all.

#ignore-readonly = no

# Mailbox name recorder
##################################################

[mbnames]

# offlineimap can record your mailbox names in a format you specify.
# You can define the header, each mailbox item, the separator,
# and the footer.  Here is an example for Mutt.
# If enabled is yes, all six setting must be specified, even if they
# are just the empty string "".
#
# The header, peritem, sep, and footer are all Python expressions passed
# through eval, so you can (and must) use Python quoting.
#
# The following hash key are available to the expansion for 'peritem':
# - accountname: the name of the corresponding account;
# - foldername: the name of the folder;
# - localfolders: path to the local directory hosting all Maildir
#   folders for the account.

# Accounts
##################################################

# This is an account definition clause.  You'll have one of these
# for each account listed in general/accounts above.

[Account Fastmail]
########## Basic settings

# These settings specify the two folders that you will be syncing.
# You'll need to have a "Repository ..." section for each one.

localrepository = LocalFastmail
remoterepository = RemoteFastmail

########## Advanced settings

# You can have offlineimap continue running indefinitely, automatically
# syncing your mail periodically.  If you want that, specify how
# frequently to do that (in minutes) here.  You can also specify
# fractional minutes (ie, 3.25).

autorefresh = 0.5
# Quick-syncs do not update if the only changes were to IMAP flags.
# autorefresh=0.5 together with quick=10 yields
# 10 quick refreshes between each full refresh, with 0.5 minutes between every 
# refresh, regardless of type.
quick = 10

# When you are starting to sync an already existing account you can tell
# offlineimap to sync messages from only the last x days.  When you do
# this messages older than x days will be completely ignored.  This can
# be useful for importing existing accounts when you do not want to
# download large amounts of archive email.
#
# Messages older than maxage days will not be synced, their flags will
# not be changed, they will not be deleted etc.  For offlineimap it will
# be like these messages do not exist.  This will perform an IMAP search
# in the case of IMAP or Gmail and therefore requires that the server
# support server side searching.  This will calculate the earliest day
# that would be included in the search and include all messages from
# that day until today.  e.g. maxage = 3 to sync only the last 3 days
# mail
#
#maxage = 30

# Specifies if we want to sync GMail lables with the local repository.
# Effective only for GMail IMAP repositories.
#
synclabels = yes

# Name of the header to use for label storage.  Format for the header
# value differs for different headers, because there are some de-facto
# standards set by popular clients:
# - X-Label or Keywords keep values separated with spaces; for these
#   you, obviously, should not have label values that contain spaces;
# - X-Keywords use comma (',') as the separator.
# To be consistent with the usual To-like headers, for the rest of header
# types we use comma as the separator.
#
#labelsheader = X-Keywords

# Set of labels to be ignored.  Comma-separated list.  GMail-specific
# labels all start with backslash ('\').
#
#ignorelabels = \Inbox, \Starred, \Sent, \Draft, \Spam, \Trash, \Important


[Repository LocalFastmail]

# Each repository requires a "type" declaration. The types supported for
# local repositories are Maildir, GmailMaildir and IMAP.

type = Maildir

# Specify local repository.  Your IMAP folders will be synchronized
# to maildirs created under this path.  OfflineIMAP will create the
# maildirs for you as needed.

[Repository RemoteFastmail]
# And this is the remote repository.  We only support IMAP or Gmail here.

# sslclientcert = /path/to/file.crt

# SSL Client key (optional)
# sslclientkey = /path/to/file.key

# SSL CA Cert(s) to verify the server cert against (optional).
# No SSL verification is done without this option. If it is
# specified, the CA Cert(s) need to verify the Server cert AND
# match the hostname (* wildcard allowed on the left hand side)
# The certificate should be in PEM format.
# sslcacertfile = /path/to/cacertfile.crt

# If you connect via SSL/TLS (ssl=true) and you have no CA certificate
# specified, offlineimap will refuse to sync as it connects to a server
# with an unknown "fingerprint". If you are sure you connect to the
# correct server, you can then configure the presented server
# fingerprint here. OfflineImap will verify that the server fingerprint
# has not changed on each connect and refuse to connect otherwise.
# You can also configure this in addition to CA certificate validation
# above and it will check both ways.
#
# Multiple fingerprints can be specified, separated by commas.
#
# Fingerprints must be in hexadecimal form without leading '0x':
# 40 hex digits like bbfe29cf97acb204591edbafe0aa8c8f914287c9.

########## Passwords

# Instead of closing the connection once a sync is complete, offlineimap will
# send empty data to the server to hold the connection open. A value of 60
# attempts to hold the connection for a minute between syncs (both quick and
# autorefresh).This setting has no effect if autorefresh and holdconnectionopen
# are not both set.

keepalive = 60

# OfflineIMAP normally closes IMAP server connections between refreshes if
# the global option autorefresh is specified.  If you wish it to keep the
# connection open, set this to true. This setting has no effect if autorefresh
# is not set.
